Bachelor in Engineering (Computer Science) - Final Year project

An interactive system for product purchase using gesture and speech recognition through the efficient use of Natural Language Processing, Convolutional Neural Networks and image processing methods. This application performs voice recognition to understand what the user is asking for, and then displays the appropriate product and explains the specifications. The user can then swipe through the products and use hand gestures to select the product they like or that meets their needs.
